Repository Contents

The repository consists of three files which are

1. Makefile : automates the process of compiling and generating output
2. packetparse.c : source file which reads packet data dump and parses it
3. smtp.pcap : packet dump files generated using tcpdump

--- 
How to run?

The source repository consists of a makefile which can be used to automate the process of compling and generating output. The makefile offers the following commands

make all
	compiles packetparse.c with the -lpcap condition

make parse
	run packetparse and parse the smtp.pcap dumpfile

make clean
	cleans the object code and generated txt files containing the parsed data

Procedural Information

The pcap library is used to gather packet data. Instead of sniffing a live network socket, the pcap library is used to read from an offline dump file created using libpcap. The pcap_loop() reads one packet at a time and calls the packet handler.

The packet handler consists of structures which have the same organization as packet data. Four strcutres are being used:
1. sniff_ethernet
	layout resembles ethernet packet header
2. sniff_ip
	layout resembles ip packet header
3. sniff_tcp
	layout resembles tcp packet header
4. sniff_udp 
	layout resembles udp packet header

The packets are read one at a time and the type of packet is determined. If IP, the program continues exploring the packet otherwsie it discards it. If the packet is IP, it extract TCP information from it and generates output.
