Repository Contents

The repository consists of three files which are

1. Makefile : automates the process of compiling and generating output
2. packetparse.c : source file which reads packet data dump and parses itd
3. smtp.pcap : packet dump files generated using tcpdump
4. datalist.c : source file which analyzes the tcp flow

--- 
How to run?

The source repository consists of a makefile which can be used to automate the process of compling and generating output. The makefile offers the following commands

make all
	compiles packetparse.c with the -lpcap condition

make parse
	run packetparse and analyze the TCP flow in the smtp.pcap dumpfile

make clean
	cleans the object code, generated txt files containing the parsed data and the files containing the TCP flow data

Procedural Information

The pcap library is used to gather packet data. Instead of sniffing a live network socket, the pcap library is used to read from an offline dump file created using libpcap. The pcap_loop() reads one packet at a time and calls the packet handler.

The handler we used this time is based on the one we used in the previous part, which catches the TCP packet and ignore the rest. 
Once a TCP packet arrives, it checks the connection status, analyzes the packet and filters out duplicate. Then, all output files are generated.

Code for sniffing packets has been derived from www.tcpdump.org/sniffex.c

Code for calculating the checksum has been dervied from several sources :
